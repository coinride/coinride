# CoinRide

The widespread use of private vehicles as taxis is inevitable.

CoinRide aims to connect passengers and drivers using Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. CoinRide will have the following attributes;

- Source code and protocols publicly available
- No central authority (blockchain will provide data services)
- Resistant to government or corporate interference
- No service fees (except bitcoin tx fees), all payments go to drivers
- Bitcoin address acts as driver/passenger identity, for payment and reputation management
- Safety encouraged by transmitting vehicle plate and photograph of driver/passenger to trusted third parties before and during ride
